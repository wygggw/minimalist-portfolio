            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.If I participate in this program, I may contribute a perspective that lies between technology and social application. I will try to explain complex concepts in more accessible language, while adding real life cases and anecdotes to present them in a more intuitive way. I will share the potential benefits and risks of AI in healthcare and explore its ethical considerations in healthcare decision-making. In addition, I may offer some thoughts on how to promote the intersection of technology and medicine, and how to better make technology serve human health.
My talk is likely to be divided into several parts: First, a compelling story or real-life case to introduce the topic, then I will briefly introduce the application of AI in healthcare, then discuss its impact and potential challenges in depth, and finally propose some solutions and a vision for the future. The entire presentation is supported by easy-to-understand examples and visual AIDS to ensure that the audience can better understand and relate to the topic.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Literature Review: Conduct an extensive literature review to understand the current state of oral non-absorbable drugs, including their formulations, mechanisms of action, and challenges.
Experimental design: Design experiments to develop and test drug formulations aimed at non-absorbable oral pathways. It involves exploring various drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles, microspheres or coatings, to facilitate controlled release or targeted delivery within the gastrointestinal tract.
Laboratory work: Conducting laboratory experiments, synthesizing drug formulations, evaluating their effectiveness, and studying their behavior in a simulated gastrointestinal environment. Techniques including encapsulation, characterization, drug release kinetics and stability studies are involved.
Data analysis: Analyze experimental data using statistical methods and specialized software to draw conclusions and identify trends that contribute to the advancement of drug delivery systems.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
